# Car-Sales Database

This repository is a final project of Pacmann's SQL & Relational Database. The task given to the students was to design a relational database to track car sales that has the following features:
  1. Every seller on this database can offer more than a second-hand car.
  2. Before selling their cars, the seller must complete their personal data such as name, phone contact, and address (the city they live in).
  3. All sellers will offer their products through an advertisement, which will be shown on a website.
  4. The advertisement will contain a title, detailed product information, and the seller's phone contact.
  5. The advertisement must include the brand, model, body type, transmission type, car production year, and price.
  6. Buyers can search for products based on the seller's location, car brand, or body type.
  7. If the buyer is interested in purchasing a car, they can bid on the price if the seller allows it.
  8. Purchase transaction is done outside the application, so it is not in the project's scope.
